        [WHAT YOU SEE. Information on different things,like past clients, rates, and services. 

        INFORMATION ON THE OWNER. I don’t plan on making this a real website for the public eye. I’m trying to decide if i want to put a fake email, phone number, and address. If I somehow want to make this for public use I would put all the necessary information so whoever looks at the website has a way to contact me if needed.
        
        Q&A.  I would like a place for users to ask questions and get an answer either by email or right there with text. Since I’m doing an unusual animal grooming site, I would like a way to be able to answer any questions regarding anything in what we do.

      <h3>[What we do]</h3>
      <p>
        [WHAT WE DO. Since I want to be able to take care of all different kinds of animals I want to offer the best services I can. How everything will be priced out is how big the animal is, what kind it is ,like if it’s a dog prices will be lower but if it's a cheetah then prices will be higher. Also I want to be able to travel ,so that will have a play in prices based on distance.
        WHAT’S OFFERED. I will simple as a nail trim all the way to making them pageant ready. Here’s a few of the things offered. Nail trim, haircut, bath, deep clean bath for exotic animals, treatment for skunk attack, color change ( dying fur, hair a different color) and a full pageant ready look. And that’s just a few options. 
        TRAVELING OFFERS. We are able to go on the road for you and your pet. Our on the go van is equipped with everything we have in store. Right now we are only able to do services in the US, eventually we want to travel all over the world.]
